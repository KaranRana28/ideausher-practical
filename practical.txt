Nodejs Task
Make a Rest API using Nodejs + Mongo DB
API requirements are as follows:


1.	Make a model of Posts (with fields: title, desc, image...)
2.	Make a Tag model and attach multiple tags to a particular post
3.	Create an endpoint to get all posts and it should be configured with the following options:
•	An Option to sort, and paginate the data 
•	An Option keyword that filters the posts that contains that keyword either in the title or description
•	An Option Tag that gives us the posts associated with that particular tag.
•	Any additional parameters beyond the specified options should result in a BAD_REQUEST response.
4.	Create an endpoint that Inserts a POST in the posts collection.
•	Upload image into base64 format in MONGODB 
					OR
•	Upload the image to cloud services (AWS S3, Cloudinary or others...)

Other requirements are -
  If possible, deploy the solution into production.   
  The code should be clean and maintainable.
  All the APIs should be well documented
  Share the POSTMAN collection of the same with examples attached to each api(s)
